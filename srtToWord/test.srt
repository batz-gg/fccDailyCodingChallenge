1
00:00:01,368 --> 00:00:04,343
Section 1. You

2
00:00:04,343 --> 00:00:07,272
will hear a young man phoning a

3
00:00:07,272 --> 00:00:08,527
town's youth council.

4
00:00:09,895 --> 00:00:12,576
First, you have some time to

5
00:00:12,576 --> 00:00:15,257
look at questions, 1:00 to 5:00.

6
00:00:18,772 --> 00:00:21,066
You will see that there is an example

7
00:00:21,066 --> 00:00:22,786
that has been done for you.

8
00:00:23,834 --> 00:00:26,613
On this occasion, only the conversation

9
00:00:26,613 --> 00:00:29,392
relating to this will be played

10
00:00:29,392 --> 00:00:29,855
first.

11
00:00:33,140 --> 00:00:35,089
Good morning, Youth Council. Caroline

12
00:00:35,089 --> 00:00:37,427
speaking. Ohh. Hello. I'm interested in

13
00:00:37,427 --> 00:00:39,765
standing for election to the Youth

14
00:00:39,765 --> 00:00:42,492
Council and I was told to give

15
00:00:42,492 --> 00:00:45,220
you a call. That's good. Could I

16
00:00:45,220 --> 00:00:47,947
have your name, please? Yes, it's Roger

17
00:00:47,947 --> 00:00:49,116
Brown. Thank you.

18
00:00:52,551 --> 00:00:55,155
The young man's name is Roger

19
00:00:55,155 --> 00:00:57,759
Brown, so Brown has been written

20
00:00:57,759 --> 00:00:59,061
in the space.

21
00:01:01,178 --> 00:01:04,158
Now we shall begin. You

22
00:01:04,158 --> 00:01:06,771
should answer the questions as you listen

23
00:01:06,771 --> 00:01:09,758
because you will not hear the recording a

24
00:01:09,758 --> 00:01:10,504
second time.

25
00:01:12,112 --> 00:01:14,728
Listen carefully and answer

26
00:01:14,728 --> 00:01:17,344
questions 1:00 to 5:00.

27
00:01:20,549 --> 00:01:22,634
Good morning, Youth Council. Caroline

28
00:01:22,634 --> 00:01:25,137
speaking. Ohh. Hello. I'm interested in

29
00:01:25,137 --> 00:01:27,639
standing for election to the Youth

30
00:01:27,639 --> 00:01:30,558
Council, and I was told to give

31
00:01:30,558 --> 00:01:33,477
you a call. That's good. Could I

32
00:01:33,477 --> 00:01:36,397
have your name, please? Yes, it's Roger

33
00:01:36,397 --> 00:01:39,316
Brown. Thank you. I'm Caroline, the Youth

34
00:01:39,316 --> 00:01:41,790
Council administrator. So do you know

35
00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:44,118
much about what the council does? Roger,

36
00:01:44,118 --> 00:01:46,446
I've talked to Stephanie. I think she's

37
00:01:46,446 --> 00:01:48,774
the chair of the council. That's right.

38
00:01:48,774 --> 00:01:51,768
And she told me a lot about it, how

39
00:01:51,768 --> 00:01:54,429
it's a way for young people to discuss

40
00:01:54,429 --> 00:01:56,424
local issues, for example, and make

41
00:01:56,424 --> 00:01:58,420
suggestions to the town council. That's

42
00:01:58,420 --> 00:02:01,332
what made me interested. Well,

43
00:02:01,332 --> 00:02:04,235
let me take down some of your details.

44
00:02:04,235 --> 00:02:07,139
First of all, how old are you? You

45
00:02:07,139 --> 00:02:09,680
know, the council is for young people

46
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:12,584
aged from 13 to 18. I've just turned

47
00:02:12,584 --> 00:02:15,488
18. And where do you live, Roger? Well,

48
00:02:15,488 --> 00:02:18,028
that's a bit complicated. At the moment

49
00:02:18,028 --> 00:02:20,569
I'm looking for a flat to rent.

50
00:02:20,649 --> 00:02:23,421
Yeah, so I'm in a hostel

51
00:02:23,421 --> 00:02:26,193
from Monday to Friday. I go

52
00:02:26,193 --> 00:02:28,965
back to my parents place at

53
00:02:28,965 --> 00:02:31,736
the weekend. OK, so where's the

54
00:02:31,736 --> 00:02:34,508
best place to send you some

55
00:02:34,508 --> 00:02:37,280
information about the council? Ohh. To

56
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:40,052
my parents address please. That's 17

57
00:02:40,052 --> 00:02:42,523
Buckley Street, BUCK. Leigh

58
00:02:42,523 --> 00:02:45,463
St. Stamford, Lincolnshire, though

59
00:02:45,463 --> 00:02:48,404
you don't really need

60
00:02:48,404 --> 00:02:51,345
the county. Ohh I

61
00:02:51,345 --> 00:02:54,286
know Stanford, it's a

62
00:02:54,286 --> 00:02:57,226
lovely town. And what's

63
00:02:57,226 --> 00:03:00,167
the post code? PE9

64
00:03:00,167 --> 00:03:03,058
7QT right?Thank you. So are

65
00:03:03,058 --> 00:03:05,960
you working here or are you a student? I

66
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:07,896
started studying at the university a

67
00:03:07,896 --> 00:03:10,798
couple of weeks ago and I've got a part

68
00:03:10,798 --> 00:03:13,701
time job for a few hours a week. What

69
00:03:13,701 --> 00:03:15,959
do you do? Well, I've done several

70
00:03:15,959 --> 00:03:17,894
different things. I've just finished a

71
00:03:17,894 --> 00:03:20,474
short term contract as a Courier and now

72
00:03:20,474 --> 00:03:23,157
I'm working as a waiter. And one of

73
00:03:23,157 --> 00:03:25,420
the big hotels? Uh-huh. That can't leave

74
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:28,007
you much time for studying. Ohh. It's not

75
00:03:28,007 --> 00:03:30,917
too bad. I managed to fit it all in.

76
00:03:30,917 --> 00:03:33,503
What are you studying? My ambition is to

77
00:03:33,503 --> 00:03:35,443
go into parliament eventually, so my

78
00:03:35,443 --> 00:03:37,383
major subject is politics. That's partly

79
00:03:37,383 --> 00:03:39,646
why I think the Youth Council is

80
00:03:39,646 --> 00:03:42,556
important and want to be a part of it.

81
00:03:42,926 --> 00:03:45,653
And I suppose you're also taking a minor

82
00:03:45,653 --> 00:03:48,380
subject, aren't you? I know a lot of

83
00:03:48,380 --> 00:03:50,426
people study economics too. I chose

84
00:03:50,426 --> 00:03:53,153
history. To be honest, I'm not finding it

85
00:03:53,153 --> 00:03:54,858
as interesting as I expected.

86
00:03:58,133 --> 00:04:00,941
Before you hear the rest of the phone

87
00:04:00,941 --> 00:04:03,748
call, you have some time to look at

88
00:04:03,748 --> 00:04:05,152
questions 6 to 10.

89
00:04:08,088 --> 00:04:11,059
Now listen and answer questions

90
00:04:11,059 --> 00:04:12,841
6 to 10.

91
00:04:16,226 --> 00:04:18,855
OK, so with your studying and your

92
00:04:18,855 --> 00:04:21,485
part time job, do you have time

93
00:04:21,485 --> 00:04:24,115
for any other interests or hobbies? Well,

94
00:04:24,115 --> 00:04:26,744
I spent quite a lot of time

95
00:04:26,744 --> 00:04:29,374
cycling both around town to get to

96
00:04:29,374 --> 00:04:32,004
university and to work, and also long

97
00:04:32,004 --> 00:04:34,258
distance from here to London for

98
00:04:34,258 --> 00:04:35,760
instance. That's pretty impressive.

99
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:38,677
Anything. For relaxation I'm also keen on

100
00:04:38,677 --> 00:04:41,440
the cinema, I used to go at least once

101
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:44,203
a week, but I can't manage to go so

102
00:04:44,203 --> 00:04:46,352
often now, right. Are you sure you'll

103
00:04:46,352 --> 00:04:48,501
have enough time for the youth council?

104
00:04:48,501 --> 00:04:51,264
Yes, I've worked out that I can afford to

105
00:04:51,264 --> 00:04:53,720
reduce my hours at work and that will

106
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:56,176
make the time. So is there any particular?

107
00:04:56,246 --> 00:04:58,907
Aspect of the Youth Council's work that

108
00:04:58,907 --> 00:05:01,568
appeals to you, Roger. Well, my sister

109
00:05:01,568 --> 00:05:03,849
is blind, so I'm particularly interested

110
00:05:03,849 --> 00:05:06,510
in working with disabled young people to

111
00:05:06,510 --> 00:05:09,172
try and improve the quality of their

112
00:05:09,172 --> 00:05:11,833
lives. That's great. Well, the best way

113
00:05:11,833 --> 00:05:14,494
to get involved is to be nominated

114
00:05:14,494 --> 00:05:17,224
by some people who you know. Right.

115
00:05:17,224 --> 00:05:19,877
Can you tell me how to set

116
00:05:19,877 --> 00:05:22,531
about organizing that? You should talk to

117
00:05:22,531 --> 00:05:24,805
Jeffrey, our elections officer. I can

118
00:05:24,805 --> 00:05:27,458
arrange a meeting in the council office

119
00:05:27,458 --> 00:05:30,112
with him if you like. Yes, please.

120
00:05:30,112 --> 00:05:32,765
He'll be here next Monday, if that

121
00:05:32,765 --> 00:05:35,419
suits you. That's the 14th, isn't it?

122
00:05:35,419 --> 00:05:38,156
Yes, I can manage. Late afternoon, would

123
00:05:38,156 --> 00:05:40,841
you like to suggest a time he

124
00:05:40,841 --> 00:05:43,143
generally leaves around 5:30? Well, would

125
00:05:43,143 --> 00:05:45,829
430 be OK? My last class finishes

126
00:05:45,829 --> 00:05:48,514
at 4:00, so I'd have plenty of

127
00:05:48,514 --> 00:05:51,200
time to get to your office, right?

128
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:53,885
That's fine. Oh, and could I have

129
00:05:53,885 --> 00:05:56,571
a phone number we can contact you

130
00:05:56,571 --> 00:05:59,249
on?Yes, my mobile

131
00:05:59,249 --> 00:06:02,148
numbers 07788136711. Thank you.

132
00:06:02,148 --> 00:06:05,048
Well, we'll look forward

133
00:06:05,048 --> 00:06:07,947
to seeing you next

134
00:06:07,947 --> 00:06:10,846
week. Thanks very much.

135
00:06:10,846 --> 00:06:13,021
Good bye. Bye.

136
00:06:16,006 --> 00:06:18,283
That is the end of Section 1.

137
00:06:19,321 --> 00:06:22,205
You now have half a minute to check

138
00:06:22,205 --> 00:06:22,926
your answers.

139
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:28,847
Now turn to Section 2.
